      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When wakeUpTime is <= 7 you would get "I can take the bus to school". If wakeUpTime is greater than 7 you would get "I can not take the bus to school". ]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If wakeUpTime is <= 7 you would get the same result, but if wakeUpTime is greater than 7 you would get "I have to take the car to school"]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[If wakeUpTime <= 7 you would still get the same, but now if wakeUpTime <=8 you would get " I can take the train to school". otherwise you would get " I have to take the car to school."]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[you would get that the value of 0 is positive, even if you give the variable the value of -0.]</p>
