    <ol>
      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[You should use constants where you don't want the value to change, and a variables (let) when you have change tha value. It can be in a loop, profile data and more]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[The parentheses allow you to change the order of which the program runs an expression. Like how you do parentheses first in math.]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[You can do this in two ways. The first is to use the ".toFixed()" method (type the number of digits inside the parentheses.). The second method is to use ".toPrecision()".
        Here you limit the whole number, not just the decimals.
        let num = 3.14159; let precisionNum = num.toPrecision(4);
        if you console.log(num) you would get 3.141.
        Both of these methods returns as a string.]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[If you make a premise that says something like:
        ((12.2 - 12.199999) < 0.01);
        you would get "True" and the program sees them as the same.
        (you sent the answer to this question on Discord)]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[the comparison operators "==" and "===" does almost the same thing. 
        The "==" operator checks if the statement is true after a type conversion. 5 == "5" returns as true.
        The "===" operator checks if the statement is true without a type conversion. 5 === "5" returns as false.
        There are more operators such as "!=", "!==", "<", ">", "<=" and ">=". 
        You can check if the statement is true or false by using: 
        an if statement

        a direct comparison. let result = 10 < 5;
        console.log(result). the output is "false". 

        you can also use Boolean() to check truthiness.]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[The Math.random() gives a random floating-number from 0 up to 1, but not 1.
        you can also get an integer by using: 
        let randomInt = Math.floor(Math.random() * (Max - Min + 1)) + Min;
        This method generates an integer between two values (Inclusive).
        The Math.random() function can be used for many things such as a dice roll, to generate a difference in "particles" if you develop games, and more.]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[Modulus (%) returns the remainder after division. 5 % 2 would return 1.
        This is useful to check if a number is even or odd, test divisibility, cycle trough sequences, or alternate between states]
