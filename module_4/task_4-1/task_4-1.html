      <li>[Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>
      <p>[It provides a structured approach to coding that enables better organization, flexibility, and robustness. These make it especially valuable in building, scaling, maintainability and complex software systems]</p>

      <li>[In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development.]</li>
      <p>[This object is used to create multiple "account types" in a single object. This makes it possible to shorten the code, reduce errors and allows for easy modifications]</p>

      <li>[Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.]</li>
      <p>[Using encapsulations helps to insure that the object's internal state is protected and can not be directly tampered with. Public members are accessible from outside the class, and can be directly modified.
        Private members are hidden from the outside, and can only be accessed or modified through specific public methods or internal logic.]</p>

      <li>[Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.]</li>
      <p>[Using new allows you to create multiple instances of the same type, each having its own unique set of properties and methods, but sharing methods defined on the constructor's prototype. 
        This is key to enabling object-oriented patterns in JavaScript.]</p>
