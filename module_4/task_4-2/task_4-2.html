      <li>[What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!]</li>
      <p>[An array is a type of "list", but we say it is a data structure that holds a collection of elements. Each element is accessed by its index. The first element is at index 0.]</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <li>[What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").]</li>
      <p>[The meaning "hardcode" means to directly alter the code, embedding a fixed value or setting in a programs source code. This codes are hard to change without altering the code.]</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <li>[Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.]</li>
      <p>[In task 3 we use the arrays ".length" property instead of a fixed value. This assures that the for loop reach each element in the array. (i < array.length).]</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <li>[Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?]</li>
      <p>[Storing instances of a class in an array makes it easier to manage and process multiple objects of the same type. It also simplifies access to each object via its index.]</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <li>[ Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
        pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
        participate in the competition!)]</li>
      <p>[The EWeekDays object contains key-value pairs: name- attribute holds a label like "Monday", "Tuesday", etc.]</p>
      <p>[value- attribute is a number that often represent bitwise flags, allowing multiple days to be grouped together under a single label.]</p>
      <p>[The element "workDays" represent Monday to Friday with a combined value indicating all five days.]</p>
      <p>[If we wanted to create a new "WorkOutDays" element, it would look something like: (WorkoutDays: {value: 0x01 + 0x04 + 0x08, name: "WorkoutDays"})]</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <li> In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.]</li>
      <p>[a callback routine in this task, the callback function wil continue until the whole array is sorted. Javascript mostly uses the quicksort algorithm or a variation of quicksort]</p>
      <p>[The .sort((a, b) => a - b) function will first save index 0 as a, and index 1 as b. Then it will see if the function is positive (if it is negative index 0 stay, if it is positive index 0 and 1 swap places).]</p>
      <p>[Then the sort function repeat again, but this time it takes index 1 as a, and index 2 as b. The function wil continue until the whole array is sorted.]</p>
      <p>[if the array looks like this: [12, 9, 5, 10, 2], it will look like [9, 5, 10, 2, 12] after one passthrough. this will continue until the array is completely sorted]</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <li>[What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.]</li>
      <p>[explanation in the previous answer]</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <li>[In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
        contains]</li>
      <p>[The first element contains the first row. It would look something like (["Row 1, Col 1", "Row 1, Col 2", ..., "Row 1, Col 9"])]</p>
